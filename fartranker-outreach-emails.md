# FartRanker Partnership Outreach Emails

---

## Email 1: FlareCare (josh@flarecare.io)

**Subject:** Content collaboration idea: FlareCare feature on FartRanker

**Body:**

Hi Josh,

I came across FlareCare while researching gut health tracking apps, and I'm impressed by your AI-powered approach to symptom tracking for IBS/IBD. The poop tracker + food diary combo is exactly what people struggling with digestive issues need.

I run FartRanker.com, a site focused on digestive health, flatulence science, and gut wellness (yes, we're serious about farts). We get solid organic traffic from people searching for terms like "why are silent farts smellier" and "fart calculator" — basically your target audience.

**I'd love to feature FlareCare in upcoming content:**
- A roundup post comparing top gut health tracking apps
- An in-depth review highlighting FlareCare's AI insights and IBS focus
- Links back to flarecare.io and your app store pages

**What's in it for you:**
- Organic traffic from our established audience
- SEO backlinks from a complementary site in your niche
- Zero effort on your part — we write everything

**Optional (but appreciated):** If you'd be open to linking back to FartRanker as a complementary tool for understanding flatulence patterns, that'd be awesome. But no pressure — the content collaboration stands on its own.

Would you be interested? Happy to send over a draft before publishing anything.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,

P.S. Saw you respond to App Store reviews personally — that's rare and awesome. Your users are lucky.

## Email 2: Gutly (support@bornly.com)

**Subject:** Partnership idea: Gutly + FartRanker content collaboration

**Body:**

Hi Bornly team,

I'm reaching out from FartRanker.com — a site dedicated to digestive health, flatulence science, and gut wellness. I discovered Gutly while researching FODMAP tracking apps, and I'm impressed by how comprehensive your app is for IBS management.

Since 2019, you've built something really solid for the FODMAP community. Your app's educational content and symptom diary features are exactly what our audience is looking for.

**Here's the collaboration idea:**
- Feature Gutly in a "Best Gut Health Tracking Apps" roundup post
- Create an in-depth review highlighting Gutly's FODMAP database and IBS coaching
- Link to Gutly's App Store page and drive organic traffic your way

**What you get:**
- Exposure to our organic search traffic (people searching gut health + flatulence terms)
- Quality SEO backlinks from an established site in your niche
- Zero effort required — we handle all the content creation

**Optional:** If Gutly would be open to mentioning FartRanker as a complementary resource for understanding flatulence patterns, we'd love that. But it's optional — the content collaboration is valuable either way.

Would the Bornly team be interested? I can share drafts before anything goes live.

Looking forward to connecting!

Best,
Mullet McNasty

P.S. Love that Gutly has been around since 2019 — that's serious staying power in the app world. Respect.

Hi Sidrit,

I came across Vitalis (gutcare.app) while researching IBS and gut health tracking apps, and I'm really impressed by your privacy-first approach and smart symptom insights. The app design is clean, modern, and clearly built with care.

I run FartRanker.com, a site focused on digestive health, flatulence science, and gut wellness. We get consistent organic traffic from people searching for gut-related topics — basically your target users.

**I'd love to feature Vitalis in upcoming content:**
- A roundup post comparing top gut health tracking apps
- An in-depth review showcasing Vitalis's privacy features and FODMAP guide
- Links back to gutcare.app and your App Store page

**What's in it for you:**
- Organic traffic from an established audience in your niche
- SEO backlinks to boost gutcare.app's domain authority
- Zero work required — we handle all content creation

**Optional:** If Vitalis would be open to linking back to FartRanker as a complementary tool for understanding flatulence patterns, that'd be fantastic. But no pressure — the content stands on its own.

Would you be interested? Happy to share drafts before publishing anything.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

P.S. The privacy-first positioning is smart — people are rightfully cautious about health data. Nice differentiator.
